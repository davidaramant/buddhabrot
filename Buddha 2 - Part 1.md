* Problem Statement
* Divide up area
  * Squares
  * Vertical number
  * Power of 2
* Method of finding boundary (start with corner)
  * Scan surrounding areas
  * Video of algorithm
  * How to make this fast (does this go here?)
* How to visualize?
  * Images get too big
  * Quad trees
    * What are they?
      * Spacial index
      * Octrees
    * De-duplication
    * Zoom
    * Diffs
    * How to store a quad tree
      * Quad tree node
      * List

  * Internal 4
  * Internal 16
* PROBLEMS

Visualizations needed:

[ ] Generic clean Mandlebrot in circle
[ ] Above but with a grid overlaid
[ ] Above but with border regions overlaid
[ ] Video of algorithm
[ ] Something for optimizing algorithm? How do you show a fixed-size buffer?
[ ] Just border but fairly high-res
[ ] Quad tree - drawn as a traditional tree
[ ] Point quad tree
[ ] Irregular region quad tree
[ ] Quad tree - 2x2
[ ] Quad tree - with border
[ ] Quad tree - deduplication example
[ ] Quad tree - zoom levels
[ ] Quad tree - diffs
[ ] Nodes (should have these?)
[ ] Corners isn't good enough
[ ] Internal 4
[ ] Internal 16
[ ] Example of problematic areas (can just take screenshots of viewer)
